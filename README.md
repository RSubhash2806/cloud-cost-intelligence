# Cloud Cost Knowledge Graph (FOCUS 1.0)

## Overview
This project builds a cloud cost reasoning system using FOCUS 1.0, a knowledge graph, and a graph-augmented RAG pipeline to explain and analyze AWS and Azure cloud costs.

## Problem Statement
Cloud billing data is complex, vendor-specific, and prone to misinterpretation. This system focuses on *explaining* cloud costs, not just reporting them.

## Status
🚧 Ontology and system design in progress.
